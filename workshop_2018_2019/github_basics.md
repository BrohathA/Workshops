#Github guide

Github is like a collective workspace for collaboration with other programmers, so that you can work on a big project together. It can also act like your online portfolio which you can put on your resume, to showcase all your personal projects which you are proud of.

We will be using git for our neurotech workshops, and you are expected to learn the basics.

Here are some wonderful resources for you to get started on git.

Understanding Git (part 1) — Explain it Like I’m Five

#After Git installation: Quick start-
1)Go to the neurotechuoft workshops repository on the github website (link should be provided to you)
2)Click on the green tab “Clone or download” and copy the git link to your clipboard
3)Open a terminal window [for windows users open command prompt (type it in start menu search)]
4)make sure git is installed. Navigate to a folder you want the workshops repo to be in. then type “git clone [link you copied]” (default is your current folder)
[commands for navigating folders -> “cd <foldername>” = switches to that folder. “Ls” or “dir” for windows users shows you a list of files and subfolders in your current folder/directory]
5) After also setting up conda (see the readme) run “jupyter notebook” in conda terminal while you’re in the workshops folder (makes it easy to directly access the workshops notebooks).
