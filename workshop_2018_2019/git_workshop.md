# Github basics
Github is a collective workspace for collaboration with other programmers so that you can work on big projects together. It can also act like your online portfolio which you can put on your resume, to showcase all your personal projects which you are proud of.

We will be using git for our neurotech workshops, and you are expected to learn the basics.

Here are some wonderful resources for you to get started with git.

When you start working on Neurotech repository (which can be found here: https://github.com/neurotechuoft/Workshops/tree/master), you are not required to do "git init" as you are working in the existing repository. In your terminal, cd into the directory you want to have a copy of this project then use "git clone ..." command to get started. 

Most basic commsnds that you should get familiar with are:
- git clone ...
- git add ...
- git commit ...
- git pull ... (When you are working with your partner on the same branch, always git pull before you do git push to avoid merge conflicts)
- git push ...
- git branch ...
- git checkout branch ...
