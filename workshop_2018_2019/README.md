# Intro to Neurotech: 2018-2019
Make artwork representing your brain with the Muse EEG headband, and learn about neurotech in the process!

## Format
Lecturing is boring! Instead, we want pairs of students to work towards the final brain-art project. Pairs will go through each week's notebook, and fill in the code and run it. If it doesn't work, no worries! We'll have mentors floating around to help pairs debug or understand concepts better.

This is going to be a cross of our workshops from 2017-2018 and our initial Prezi workshops, but with less emphasis on hardware and more emphasis on sofware techniques and the brain.

## Schedule:

Week 1: Intro to Python
Absolute basics of programming
