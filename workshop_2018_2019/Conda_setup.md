This guide is for getting Anaconda up and running on your local computer and ready for starting a new project. If you have trouble at any point, most if not all the information can be found here: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments

# Installation
Follow the instructions here to download and install Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. You will be using this throughout the workshops.

## Confirm installation
To verify that you installed correctly, try to run the Anaconda Navigator (see https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/) Alternatively, try runnning "conda --version" in a Terminal window. It should respond with the version of conda you have installed.

# Environments
In every project that you make, you will want to create a separate 'virtual environment' which will contain only the packages you need for the project.
See here for how to setup and manage an environment in Anaconda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments

# Managing packages
The main commands related to packages in conda are "search", "list", and "install". More information can be found here: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-packages
