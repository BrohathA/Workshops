# Angular Workshop
Angular is front-end frame webframework mostly used to build single page applications. For this workshop, we will be using Angular to show your brain-art in the browser.

## Install Node.js, npm, Angular
You must have Node.js and npm package manager installed in your machine before getting started with angular. After you have those two, install angular. Node.js and npm can be installed from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. To install angular: run this command in your terminal (no quotes): "npm install -g angular-cli"

Follow the instructions here to set up your environment: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local

To make your workshop experience as useful as possible, make sure you have angular setup and ready to go at the start of the workshop (this means installing everything you need beforehand!), because you will be diving straight into writing your first angular application!

## Basic Angular tutorial
To be able to use Angular, it is essential that you have the very basic idea of HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript. If you are not familiar with these already, we highly recommend that you go through the resources below for HTML, CSS, JavaScript before doing the angular tutorial.

Once you have everything installed and project initiated, go here to get started with Angular https://angular.io/start. Follow this tutorial to create your first angular app and to get used to the basics of Angular. You are only required to go through "Your First App" section for the purpose of this workshop.

Additionally, you can watch this helpful video tutorial to get a better grasp of Angular: https://youtu.be/5wtnKulcquA

**Optional** For those who really enjoyed Angular and are curious to learn more: https://angular.io/tutorial

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript resources
You can always google just the part you need for each component but it is necessary to have the basic idea so that you know what to google. Use the following resources to familarize yourself with each language if you are not already aware of them.

### HTML
- Best resource for learning as well as future reference to look up any syntax:
    - https://www.w3schools.com/html/
- This is also a good resource for the beginners to get started:
    - https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/v/making-webpages-intro

### CSS
This is what you need to use to style/customize your brain-art.
- Like HTML, this is one of the best resource to learn CSS:
    - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp

### JavaScript/TypeScript
Use this tutorial to learn JavaScript for free. You are required to make an account but it's free.
- https://www.sololearn.com/Course/JavaScript/

These are some additional resources on JavaScript for your reference:
- https://www.w3schools.com/js/
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript so if you know JavaScript (JS), you will learn TypeScript(TS) in no time. To learn about the differences and similarities between JS and TS, watch this video.
- https://youtu.be/WBPrJSw7yQA

Use this site as the reference for TypeScript: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/typescript/

### JSON
JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) respresents structured data by using key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and values are valid JSON data types. JSON data types include string, number, boolean, object, array, and null. JSON objects could be easily transmitted across networks and are straight forward to work with. 

Example: { "class": "Angular Tutorial", "sessions": 1, "topics": ["Javascript", "JSON", "HTML", "CSS"] }

Here is a good resource to get some intro to JSON objects and learn how to work with them:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON

Two of the most common methods used with JSON objects are JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify(), which convert string->JavaScript object and JavaScript object->string correspondingly. 
- https://alligator.io/js/json-parse-stringify/

## Debugging using console
Use console.log(<variableHere>); if you want to print out certain variable's value in your console. It is particularly useful when you are learning Angular for the first time or trying to debug your code.

Alternatively, Y\you can always use the debugger that comes with your IDE.

## Importing libraries 
Sometimes you might want to use some published libraries to import certain functions so that you don't have to write them yourselves. Here is a quick guide on how to do that: https://angular.io/guide/using-libraries
