Missed the workshop? Here's what to do:
1. Open the lecture link above, and navigate to the second slide. There is a link there to repl.it—click that!
    - Now, you should have your slides open, plus repl.it for running your codes (easiest if you pull these up in split-screen)
2. Go through the slides, running codes wherever the slides direct you to do so
3. Once you've reached the end, if you still feel like you want more Python practice before our next Python session, try some of the Easy problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)!

Notes: 
- Since this was the first week and we moved through the the slides in small groups, there is no recording for this session
- At the start of the session, I did a brief demo of a simple brain-computer interface—don't worry if you missed that, I'll show it again!

Administrative Notes:
- Each week, you will start receiving an email from us giving you a brief overview of the following week's workshop session, and anything that you could prepare or review to make the material easier to learn
- For most sessions (whenever relevant), the recording will be found if you click on the link for that week (i.e. if there were a recording for this week, you would see it on this page)
