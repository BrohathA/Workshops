# Intermediate Workshops

Just like the Intro to Neurotech course, this course will rely heavily on labs to make the workshops more interactive and experiential. The course will center around a year-long project, and each week will have milestones leading to the completion of a part of this project. Lectures will be used as a way of conveying theoretical material, and readings will be used to supplement each week's lab. In addition, a paper that relates to the week's topic will be assigned each week for skimming.


## Textbook
We will rely on a few textbooks. Chapters 1-5 from the Deep Learning Book (freely available) (Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville) will supplement material for Weeks 2, 5, and 6. A textbook for Weeks 10-16 (hardware) will be posted soon. Weeks 17-24 will feature selected chapters from various textbooks and journal articles.

## Course Project: A Classifier for Event-Related Potentials
* Encorporating cloud machine learning, analog hardware, and IoT

## Milestones
* Create an app that streams EEG in real-time using MuseJs
* Design a simple ML model for blink detection
* Design an ML model for some ERP (P300, N170, etc)
* Deploy the ML model onto the cloud for real-time analysis
* Design and build an EEG acquisition circuit
* Complete circuit and model for real-time ERP classification
