# Week 2: (October 7) Intro to React

### What is React?
- A component-based JavaScript library made by Facebook to simplify the creation of user interfaces
	- Did you know? Both Instagram and Facebook rely on React!
- Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create singlepage web applications (and more)
	- HTML handles structure; CSS handles presentation, formatting, and layout; JS handles the behaviour of different elements
- Compared to alternatives (like Angular), much easier to employ
	- You can take a pre-existing project and add React to it without too much difficulty

### Why should I learn it?
- You can't make a brain-computer interface without an interface! After all, we want to be able to view and interact with our data
- React is currently the most popular choice among developers for making a UI

### If you missed the session:
1. Check out the lecture recording above! It's a rather brief intro/demo to what React is and what it can do
2. Decide whether you'd like to make your app locally or on CodePen (which eliminates the set-up step of [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), although you should install it anyway—choose the LTS version)
3. Work your way through React's introductory [hands-on tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)! After this tutorial, you should understand the basics of making an app and adding interactivity—this will help you immensely when we start making our BCIs
